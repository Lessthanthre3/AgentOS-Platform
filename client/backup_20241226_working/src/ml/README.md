# Neural Network Integration for AgentOS Platform

This integration combines TensorFlow.js with GPT-3.5 to create an adaptive learning system that improves over time based on user interactions and performance.

## Components

### 1. Learning Model (LearningModel.js)
- Neural network architecture for analyzing user learning patterns
- Features tracked:
  - Time spent on topics
  - Number of attempts
  - Correct answer rate
  - Response times
  - Help requests
  - Topic revisits
  - Completion rates
  - Engagement scores

### 2. AI Assistant (AIAssistant.js)
- Real-time voice interaction
- GPT-3.5 powered responses
- Context-aware help
- Progress tracking
- Adaptive difficulty adjustment

### 3. Training Module (TrainingModule.js)
- Interactive learning interface
- Progress tracking
- Quiz system
- Real-time feedback
- Performance metrics collection

### 4. User Progress Hook (useUserProgress.js)
- Data collection system
- Learning metrics calculation
- Model training management
- Progress persistence
- Learning recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - User interactions are tracked in real-time
   - Performance metrics are calculated
   - Learning patterns are identified

2. **Model Training**
   - Neural network is trained periodically
   - Learning patterns are analyzed
   - Recommendations are generated

3. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Content difficulty adjusts based on performance
   - AI Assistant provides personalized help
   - Learning path optimizes automatically

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - System learns from all users
   - Content effectiveness is measured
   - Teaching methods are refined

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @tensorflow/tfjs openai
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. Import components:
   ```javascript
   import LearningModel from '../ml/LearningModel';
   import AIAssistant from '../ai/AIAssistant';
   import TrainingModule from '../training/TrainingModule';
   ```

## Usage

1. The AI Assistant is always available in the bottom-right corner
2. Voice commands can be used for navigation and help
3. Training modules adapt to user performance
4. Progress is automatically saved and analyzed

## Data Privacy

- All learning data is stored locally
- Model training is done on the client side
- No personal information is shared
- Only anonymized metrics are used for improvements
