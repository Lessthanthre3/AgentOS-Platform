# AgentOS Wallet Module

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Pending Configurations

Before the wallet module can be fully functional, the following configurations need to be added:

1. **RPC Endpoint**
   - Add a reliable Solana RPC endpoint to the environment variables
   - Location: `.env` file
   - Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_ENDPOINT`
   - Example: `https://your-rpc-endpoint.com`

2. **AIS Token Contract**
   - Add the AIS token contract address
   - Location: `.env` file
   - Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AIS_TOKEN_ADDRESS`
   - Note: This will be the deployed contract address of the AIS token

## TODO List

- [ ] Configure production RPC endpoint
- [ ] Deploy AIS token contract
- [ ] Add AIS token contract address
- [ ] Test token balance fetching
- [ ] Test Jupiter swap integration
- [ ] Add price feeds for token values

## Structure Overview

The wallet module is set up but waiting for these configurations to be fully operational. Current features include:
- Balance tracking (SOL + AIS)
- Token swaps via Jupiter
- Transaction history
- Portfolio overview

## Notes

Remember to:
1. Use a reliable RPC endpoint to handle high traffic
2. Consider RPC rate limits and fallback options
3. Test thoroughly after adding contract address
4. Monitor RPC performance in production
